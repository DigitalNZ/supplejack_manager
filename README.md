# Supplejack Manager

The Supplejack Manager is a rails application that provides a visual interface into the harvesting and link checking processes within the harvester worker.

* Create parsers.
* Run/view harvests.
* Schedule harvests.
* Preview a record before it is harvested.
* Define parser templates.
* Suppress a collection in the Supplejack API.
* View all suppressed collections in the Supplejack API.
* Define rules for checking links in the Supplejack API.
* View the statistics for the link checker
